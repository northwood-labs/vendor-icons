# Vendor icons

Used primarily for internal documents, charts/diagrams, etc.

## Usage

Icons/logos for a variety of vendors. For most people, a service like [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) is probably better for you to use.

As much as possible, we've used the original brand assets. The images themselves focus on the "bug" (symbol) part of the logo, and have been resized into a square shape. Some square shapes have extra padding so that they fit better inside a circular mask.

Any branding requirements about spacing between the logo and other elements should be observed by the consumer of these brand assets.

## License, Copyright, Trademark

All logos/trademarks are owned by their respective companies. Only use them with permission.
